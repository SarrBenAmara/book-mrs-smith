with my family in a little village near
London. Originally, I and my family
come from America. I share a
detached house with my husband,
three children, my sister-in-law
and her husband.
Anyway, we have a quite big
house with a wonderful
garden. In the garden, we
keep animals.
We have pets and domestic
animals such as turkeys,
chickens, geese and
ducks, too.]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[In this beautiful garden, we have a wonderful
flower-bed and a vegetable garden. In the house,
there are three big bedrooms, a
sitting-room, a little dining-room,
a hall, a nice kitchen,
a study, a bathroom with a
toilet
In our house, we have
got a lot of devices, for
example, a washing-machine,
a dishwasher, a modern
microwave oven,an oven,
a TV, a hi-fi set, an iron,
a CD and a DVD-player.]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[I really like our house as it is big,
comfortable, modern and very beautiful.
The walls are coloured, the
house is decorated with
pictures, photos, spot lights,
potted flowers. I think it is
very fantastic!
As for my job, I am the manager
of a famous company in London.
I usually get up at seven, I go to the
bathroom, comb my hair,
wash my face and teeth to be
fresh. After that I go to
the kitchen to make fine
breakfast for my family.]]></page><page Index="7"><![CDATA[I normally make some delicious
sandwiches with ham and
cheese. I always start my
work at eight am. At the
work I am sometimes tired.
I have a lot of things to do.
After work at about
5 pm, I go home and
help my children
do their homework.
I am good at Mathematics
and Grammar so I can help
them.]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[In the evenings, I usually go for a walk
with my little dog. At 8 pm, we eat
something for dinner, for example, ham
and eggs or cold cuts with bread and
butter. We generally go to
bed at about 10 pm after
watching TV.
Would you like to know
anything about my
clothing habits? I like
wearing casual clothes at
home such as a tracksuit with
trainers.]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[However, when I work, I usually wear
elegant pieces of clothes, for example, a
costume with stockings and high-heel shoes.
I use some make-up, too. I think I am a
well-dressed woman.

I am not overweight, but I am not slim at
all. I believe I am quite tall for a woman. I
have nice long curly ginger hair and green
eyes.
In my free time, I like reading, watching
movies and doing the aerobics twice a week.
Fortunately, I enjoy cooking. I can cook
and bake very well. My family loves the
food I make!]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[What about checking your understanding?
